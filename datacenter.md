In 2013, Facebook opened a data center in Lulea, Sweeden. This paricular data center was created with enviromental impact in mind. Lulea, Sweeden is a cold location which reduces the need for artificially cooling the center and can instead utilize ambient temperature to achieve their necessary operating temperature. Furthermore, the data center has access to hydro electricity, reducing the CO2 impact and cost to operate.
