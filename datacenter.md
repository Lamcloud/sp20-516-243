In 2013, Facebook opened a data center in Lulea, Sweeden. This paricular data center was created with enviromental impact in mind. Lulea, Sweeden is a cold location which reduces the need for artificially cooling the center and can instead utilize ambient temperature to achieve their necessary operating temperature. Furthermore, the data center has access to hydro electricity, reducing the CO2 impact and cost to operate.

 I produce approximately 1428 lbs of CO2 per year.

Hydro electricity, as mentioned in the E.Datacenter.2b section, is the primary energy source for Facebook's Lulea, Sweeden data center. 
However, they also use thermal energy to cool the plant. There are at least two type of thermal energy, the first is the ambient energy of the air. This is the primary thermal energy that the Lulea plant uses. As it is cold in Lulea, the cold air allows less electric energy be used to cool the servers. The other type is geo-thermal. My home is cooled (and to a degree, heated) using geo-thermal energy. A fluid is circulated under ground to bring its temperature close to the average temerpature of the ground. This fluid is then pumped throught the house and the temperature of the house is heated or cooled based on the temerpature of the liquid.
